This project examines the career trajectories and success metrics of NBA general managers (GMs) from
2010 to 2024. With aspirations of becoming a GM, I developed a dataset to analyze the credentials, career
paths, and success levels of individuals who have held these positions. The dataset includes variables such as
education, professional playing experience, and prior roles. I also created a General Manager Success Index
(GMSI) to quantify performance, though it remains a work in progress. GMSI is a weighted average including
the following columns and weight: Tenure (10%), Regular season winning percentage (15%), Playoff winning
percentage (25%), Playoff appearances (10%), and a special equation for Championships (35%). This is a
project I hope to continue to revise in the future as my skills as a data scientist improve. The primary goal
of this project is to identify trends and patterns among NBA GMs that can inform aspiring professionals
about the qualifications and pathways to success. Additionally, the study evaluates the relationship between
certain variables and measurable success, as quantified by the GMSI.
